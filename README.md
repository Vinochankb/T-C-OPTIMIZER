#T-C OPTIMIZER
In the digital age, deciphering complex terms and conditions (T&Cs) governing user data remains a daunting task, leaving individuals vulnerable to potential privacy breaches. This research investigates the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address this challenge, empowering users with clear and actionable insights into their digital privacy and also making tedious reading easier. We developed an NLP-based system that analyses and judges on real-world T&Cs from diverse sources. Leveraging data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques, the system employs a novel combination of K-Nearest Neighbours and Naive Bayes classifiers to assess potential privacy risks within the text. This approach achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.85 in identifying privacy concerns, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both known and unknown data sets. Beyond the technical merits, this research highlights the ethical and societal implications of such NLP-powered tools. By bridging the gap between complex legal jargon and user comprehension, our work paves the way for user-friendly privacy communication tools. These tools can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their data and awareness can be spread about data that is being collected, fostering a digital ecosystem where privacy is respected and protected. While further research is needed to refine and expand the capabilities of this system, this initial exploration opens exciting possibilities for enhancing user privacy in today's data-driven world.
